# Portfolio â€” Two Fixes Only (with favicon)
Generated 2025-08-08

## Fixes
1. **Resume button** is a direct link to `assets/resume.pdf` (works on user & project sites).
2. **Mobile responsiveness**: nav visible at small widths, hero stacks, images are responsive, thumbnails use aspect-ratio, no overflow.

## How to use
1. Replace `assets/resume.pdf` with your real resume.
2. (Optional) Replace `assets/avatar.jpg` with a headshot.
3. Push to your GitHub repo.
